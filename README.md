## About
This project was completed as part of the two-day [Rails Hackathon 2022](https://railshackathon.com/) that required Hotwire be used as part of the stack.

The goal of the web application is to help children who are learning to read in (primarily) English and Spanish. The application hosts a library of stories; within each story, some phrases are randomly translated to Spanish. The reader can keep score of how many phrases are correctly translated.

Context uses context clues as an effective means of teaching and understanding Spanish.
